# ANLY580-Final-Project-Music-Creation-Classification-Transformation

The team plans to build and create musics utilizing LSTM and GPT models that can also helps us make classification and transformation of the music. 
The team will build and apply multiple machine learning
models to train on the datasets such that the input data can be transformed into different musics
for evaluation and recreation.

In addition, based on the different models, the team will make evaluations by comparing the
music results based on the note frequency of the music with visulizations of sound waves. The
standard would be base on the implementations of spectrogram with exponential weights or log spectrogram for
identifying which music produced by the model has smoother and more realistic sound. In this
way, the team will identify the best model for creating music.

Furthermore, based on the model and the visulizations, the team plans to
create a new model procedure such that the input music can be classified into different types based on the datasets. 

In addition, we also aim to build other model to help transforme the input music into other music with
different methods such as stretching, scaling. 
Therefore, the results of this project consist of presenting different music produced by different
implementations of models; comparisons among the musics based on the visulizations and
classification accuracy and labels as evaluations; and the transformation model.

The team thinks that this topic is interesting because it can help us understand and explore the
role of machine learning in the process of creating art and music. Music always plays a great role
in our life. We are all curious about how music are made both in real life and through machine
learning. In addition, by implementing the models to produce music and transformation,
these results can potentially be used by music composers and producers to generate music and art
for different works. By applying different models to produce different types of the musics will
also allow us to have further understandings and more insights on some other language modelings.




Note:
The datasets that the team intends to use are the music datasets in different formats such as ABC,
MIDI, and MISC datasets.
For instance, the OpenEWLD Dataset, MAESTRO Dataset, music21â€™s Corpus, and other
sources of music datasets.

The datasets files are too large to upload into the git repository.
